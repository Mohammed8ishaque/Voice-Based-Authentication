# Voice-Based Authentication System

## Overview

The **Voice-Based Authentication System** is a biometric security solution that authenticates users based on their voice patterns. This system leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and verify a user's voiceprint, providing a secure and user-friendly authentication method.

### Features

**Biometric Security:** Uses voice patterns for authentication.

**Machine Learning:** Implements AI models to distinguish between users.

**Speaker Recognition:** Identifies and verifies users based on their unique voiceprints.

**Real-Time Authentication:** Provides quick and accurate verification.

**Secure and Efficient:** Minimizes the risk of unauthorized access.

### Technologies Used

**Python:** Core programming language.

**Librosa:** For audio processing and feature extraction.

**TensorFlow/Keras:** Deep learning framework for model training.

**scikit-learn:** Used for machine learning model implementation.

**NumPy & Pandas:** Data handling and preprocessing.

**Flask:** Web framework for API integration (if applicable).

Installation

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.x

Pip (Python package manager)

Steps

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Mohammed8ishaque/Voice-Based-Authentication.git
cd Voice-Based-Authentication

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the system:

python authentication.py

Usage

Registration: Users must provide voice samples for enrollment by running register.py.

Feature Extraction: The system extracts unique voice features and saves them.

Authentication: Users can verify their identity using authentication.py.
